# PyBuild


PyBuild is a Python library to programmatically build your Python programs using PyInstaller.


## Installation


```bash
pip install pybuild
```


## PyInstaller Integration


PyBuild includes two classes to manage PyInstaller builds:

The `GuiProgramBuilder` class manages building PyInstaller executables without the terminal.
The `TerminalAppBuilder` class manages building PyInstaller executables with the terminal
